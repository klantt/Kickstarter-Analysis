# Kickstarter-Analysis

Performing analysis on kick starter data to uncover trends 

# Kickstarting with Excel 

## Overview of this project is analyzing a data set given to me to organize.

### The overall purpose of this project was to filter data provided into a readable document outlining the success and sometimes not successful Kickstarter projects for theater.

## The one biggest challenge for me was learning hotkeys to efficiently move, place and input data into excel to save time. 

### The biggest outcome that stood out to me was how important it seemed to launch a play in the months of June, and July seeing as those two months were so far ahead of any other launch date.

### The biggest take away for me from looking at the data for outcomes based on goals was that there was not a single canceled project. 

### The challenges and difficulties I faced was definitely keeping my main first sheet of data organised and neat. I found myself getting lost and having to go back and clean some columns/ rows up. 

### Results 

- One coclusion I can say is that the best month to launch is June and July. Second is that I noticed the amount failed never really vaired by month it was all very similar even with the large outlier months of June and July.

- I can conlude that the less expensive a project the more likely it will be funded as it seems like a more attainable end goal and more people and donate to the project.

- Some limitations of this data set I noticed was that the limitation of provided categories could've been widened, or secondly that the set of data length could've spanned farther. 

- I believe another possibility for readable charts/tables could include a 2-D column graph or even a combo graph.
